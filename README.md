# The objective of this project is to prepare the data for analysis. 
# The input is the data stored on the internet
# The outputs are 1. Prepared combined Data set and
#    2. Independent tidy data set with average values of all variables 
# The code in the run_analysis.R performs following steps to get the desired results
# Step 1: Prepare the files
# Step 2: Prepare the descriptive names
# Step 3: Prepare Training data. Read and add columns.
# Step 4: Prepare test data. Read and add columns.
# Step 5: Merge training and test data
# Step 6: use descriptive activity names
# Step 8: create independed tidy data set
# You may run the code by using source("./run_analysis.R") when the directory is
#   project directory.However, There is one manual step that requires unzipping of
#   files using appropriate software (I used 7zip).
